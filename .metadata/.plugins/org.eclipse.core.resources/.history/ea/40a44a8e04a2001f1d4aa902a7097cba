Answer 1: 
The "Buffer beyond capacity" error occurs in SharedBuffer.java on line 20 due to a race condition. 
The issue stems from the non-atomic nature of the check-then-act sequence in the produce method:

Thread A checks buffer.size() >= capacity (false)
Thread B checks buffer.size() >= capacity (false)
Thread A adds an item
Thread B adds an item

As the size check and add operation aren't atomic, 
multiple producers can simultaneously pass the size check and add items, 
potentially exceeding the capacity. 
Using Thread.yield() makes the problem worse by increasing the chance of thread interleaving.

Answer 2: 
The null retrieval issue in Consumer.java (line 17) occurs due to a similar race condition in the 
consume method:

Consumer A checks buffer.isEmpty() (false)
Consumer B checks buffer.isEmpty() (false)
Consumer A polls the last item
Consumer B polls (returns null since buffer is now empty)

The check for emptiness and the poll operation aren't atomic, 
so multiple consumers can pass the empty check but only one will get the last item, 
while others get null.


Both issues stem from:

Lack of proper synchronization
Non-atomic operations on the shared buffer
Busy waiting with Thread.yield() which doesn't provide any guarantees

The current implementation attempts to handle concurrency using busy waiting, which is both inefficient and incorrect. 
The solution requires proper synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread-safe access to the shared buffer.
